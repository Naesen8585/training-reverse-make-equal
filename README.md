Reverse to Make Equal

Given two arrays A and B of length N, determine if there is a way to make A equal to B by reversing any subarrays from array B any number of times.

Signature

bool areTheyEqual(int[] arr_a, int[] arr_b)

Input

All integers in array are in the range [0, 1,000,000,000].

Output

Return true if B can be made equal to A, return false otherwise.

Example

A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

B = [1, 4, 3, 2]

output = true

After reversing the subarray of B from indices 1 to 3, array B will equal array A.
